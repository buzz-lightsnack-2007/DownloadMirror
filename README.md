# DownloadMirror
Download any file from the web, just using Google CoLab's servers. 
**[▶︎ Run](https://colab.research.google.com/github/buzz-lightsnack-2007/DownloadMirror/blob/main/DownloadMirror.ipynb)**

## How This Came
Imagine if you were downloading from the internet with a very slow connection, then all of a sudden the download fails … what a pain! 

It's better to have at least an online copy of the file, doesn't it? 

But Google is Google. Internet speeds should be quite fast in Google's servers. So, let's take advantage of that to ensure a smooth download! 

## How to Use
**[Use it from here.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/buzz-lightsnack-2007/DownloadMirror/blob/main/DownloadMirror.ipynb)**

Type the URL of the file, put the file name (if you want it), and run! In no time, your local download should be ready.

## Planned
- block user from setting file names with slashes
- detect failed download to prevent from proceeding
